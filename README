64tass v1.53 reference manual

This is the manual for 64tass, the multi pass optimizing macro assembler for
the 65xx series of processors. Key features:

  * Open source portable C with minimal dependencies
  * Familiar syntax to Omicron TASS and TASM
  * Supports 6502, 65C02, R65C02, W65C02, 65CE02, 65816, DTV, 65EL02, 4510
  * Arbitrary-precision integers and bit strings, double precision floating
    point numbers
  * Character and byte strings, array arithmetic
  * Handles UTF-8, UTF-16 and 8 bit RAW encoded source files, Unicode character
    strings
  * Supports Unicode identifiers with compatibility normalization and optional
    case insensitivity
  * Built-in `linker' with section support
  * Various memory models, binary targets and text output formats (also Hex/
    S-record)
  * Assembly and label listings available for debugging or exporting
  * Conditional compilation, macros, structures, unions, scopes

Contrary how the length of this document suggests 64tass can be used with just
basic 6502 assembly knowledge in simple ways like any other assembler. If some
advanced functionality is needed then this document can serve as a reference.

This is a development version. Features or syntax may change as a result of
corrections in non-backwards compatible ways in some rare cases. It's difficult
to get everything `right' first time.
